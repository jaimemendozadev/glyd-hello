## Initial Setup

Open up your terminal and clone the repo locally to your computer by running the following command at the target destination: `$ git clone https://github.com/jaimemendozadev/jaimemendoza_v2.git`


## Starting the App
- Make sure you have the [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) package manager installed.

- You will also need the [React Native CLI](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) to start the app. Please consult the documents for installing the CLI on your computer.

- Open a Terminal window and go to the repo root. From the root, run `$ yarn install`. Wait until all the dependencies have finished loading.

- In another Terminal window, run `$ react-native run-ios` to fire up the iOS simulator. Two separate tabs will open in your Terminal. One tab displays the status of the Xcode build that creates the actual iOS application. You'll have to wait patiently while Xcode builds the app. The other tab opens the React Packager that loads the dependencies. When the iOS simulator pops open, the app splash page should load.
